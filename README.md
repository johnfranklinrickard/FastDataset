# FastDataset
A Test to see how fast the dataset generation part can be in comparison to the python implementation

## Results
The first primitive implementation is already a lot faster.

python implementation from https://github.com/johnfranklinrickard/PixelShiftSR needs roughly 22 minutes for 100 images and all configurations

the c++ implementation here needs around 100 seconds for 100 images.


## Educational topics for this project:

- C++ data handling
- visual studio
- profiling
